1162,1163,5,"The memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, enholds a mood of happiness and warmth, which is described in several ways. Happiness serves as an apt description of the mood in the story, due to the narrator's constant reference to a joyful essence which fills her apartment house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" This represents how happiness transpires throughout their home, and how everybody can feel free to be whoever they want to be. Consequently, Narciso's house is a warm, happy environment. Another example which describes the mood in the memoir is how Narciso explains how there is always a friend or family member in the house. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote, spoken by Narciso, further explains how growing up surrounded by love and laughter and warmth, creates a positive influence that remains instilled in a person forever. This reflects how the mood of the story is happiness as well. Finally, a last example which concludes how the mood is described within the memoir is how the author illustrates the admiration that Narciso feels for his parents.

The mood of happiness is expressed when Narciso is talking about his friends in the community and family. At the table, when at least one of his extended family members joined him regularly, Narciso set a mood that was very happy. During those meals that him and his family had, they would often laugh. Laughing and humor were another specific mood of Narciso's memoir. In the parentheses, Narciso put a personal touch of his experiences. For example, when talking about 'rich culinary skills', the parentheses said, 'and for which I am eternally grateful.' The extra information had a hint of humor and kindness. Kindness is the third mood set by Narciso. He had a kind tone when talking about his parents, and how generous and loving they were. He also had a kind tone when talking about the friendship in his community. Friendships like, extending 'hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearily in need'.
