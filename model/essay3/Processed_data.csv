So my mother said.â get on another ride thenâ. We already tried the other rides,â my father said. So we stayed at the end of the line until it was our turn, and said that was the last ride, soon there were people behind us complaining, their younger children was getting mad, and parents was hollering. We just stood there, and kept being patient. That didnât desterb us. since we were raised to be patient, and wait our turn at things. I feel being patient is very important, because if you act up in line, you might make people think theyâre holding you up, but itâs the line moving slow. Advice: when you are waiting at the end of the line, donât shout, scream, holler, or yell at anyone, it only creates trouble. Just donât think about all of the people ahead of you, talk to someone, just take your mind off of it for a while, then youâll notice, the line is moving quicker than you expected. P.S. We enjoyed the ride.",6,I going write time I went fair  fun  saw ride wanted get  got line  Suddenly  noticed end line  So mother said get another ride then  We already tried rides   father said  So stayed end line turn  said last ride  soon people behind us complaining  younger children getting mad  parents hollering  We stood  kept patient  That didnt desterb us  since raised patient  wait turn things  I feel patient important  act line  might make people think theyre holding  its line moving slow  Advice  waiting end line  dont shout  scream  holler  yell anyone  creates trouble  Just dont think people ahead  talk someone  take mind  youll notice  line moving quicker expected  PS  We enjoyed ride ,840,222,13,3.7837837837837838,3,45,55,9,14

67,68,7,"One of the greatest ways for a person to have patience is when you are being hunted down in a game of paintball. I have had experience once, and I hope it never happens again. I was playing paintball with a lot of my friends, and if I was not patient, I would have ended up getting shot in the head with paint. I was in a small forest, breathing hard after a close encounter, and I was behind a really thin tree. I had eliminated everyone except for one.I started breathing harder, because he was right by the tree I was leaning against. I decided I would come close to sacrificing myself if I just stood there, so I climbed up the tree.I was lucky I had a camoflage shirt on, because if I didnât blend in, I would get shot. I was deep in the tree, but it wouldnât have mattered, because I was too heavy for any of the branches. I fell out of the tree, but as I was falling, I shot the enemy in the leg. I had won! That is how patience rewards you.",8,One greatest ways person patience hunted game paintball  I experience  I hope never happens  I playing paintball lot friends  I patient  I would ended getting shot head paint  I small forest  breathing hard close encounter  I behind really thin tree  I eliminated everyone except oneI started breathing harder  right tree I leaning  I decided I would come close sacrificing I stood  I climbed treeI lucky I camoflage shirt  I didnt blend  I would get shot  I deep tree  wouldnt mattered  I heavy branches  I fell tree  I falling  I shot enemy leg  I  That patience rewards ,732,194,10,3.7731958762886597,3,29,46,11,14

So I made up a game to play with him so he would forget about the helicopter and stop asking me. It didnât work, because he kept on asking me any way. I made up another game where you have to jump on the trampoline and spin your arms like a helicopter and not fall over.

I was so excited about getting the new game that I mentioned it a lot not remembering my dad telling me not to tell my mom.

When I asked my dad why not he said it was because I didnât keep my mouth shut so my mom didnât want me to have it at the moment. Now I was angry of course because my mom always says nor has something to say to my dad and me when I get a game.

I was doing them down the wedge, and in the middle of each one, I'd do a little roll for fun. Someone called so she walked out of the gym to talk to them. Just because she was my coach, didn't mean that she should tell me when I should, or shouldn't do my back flip. I really wanted to try it, and was out of the room, so it was my chance.

94,95,7,"Patience is important in life. Something when you donât have patience things tend to go wrong and thatâs not always a good thing so here are somethings when you do not have patience. If you donât have patience you can get into trouble. For example if you were in a long line for something and you couldnât talk because if you did talk you would get in trouble. So if you didnât have any patience you would probably say my gosh this is taking forever. Then you would get in trouble for talking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. You should have patience for an example if you didnât you would need patience if you were sick and you went to the doctors office and there was a really long line you would probably say for get it and then go home. So if you went home you would get even more sick and that would get even more sick and that would be bad. Finally, another reason on if you didnât have patience. For example say you wanted to go the mall and bye a new pair of shoes. You went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right. But when you went to go check out the cash regaster didnât work so they had to call maitnence, to come and fix it and they told you that it would be an hour. So you sat and waited for twenty minutes but you did not have any patience so you said for get it and you left and didnât get the shoes. Those were some people who didnât have patience. But if they did that wouldnât of happened to them because they would of waited or needed. Having patience is a good thing but not having it is not.",3,Patience important life  Something dont patience things tend go wrong thats always good thing somethings patience  If dont patience get trouble  For example long line something couldnt talk talk would get trouble  So didnt patience would probably say gosh taking forever  Then would get trouble talking  Here another reason patience  You patience example didnt would need patience sick went doctors office really long line would probably say get go home  So went home would get even sick would get even sick would bad  Finally  another reason didnt patience  For example say wanted go mall bye new pair shoes  You went store found pair liked fit right  But went go check cash regaster didnt work call maitnence  come fix told would hour  So sat waited twenty minutes patience said get left didnt get shoes  Those people didnt patience  But wouldnt happened would waited needed  Having patience good thing ,1231,322,17,3.8229813664596275,4,59,77,13,27

When my brother broke his finger it seemed like he was My mom wanted to see his hand and his knuckles and all that stuff that moms always do. It seemed like it took so long to ask my mom a question if she was in the same room as my brother. My mom called the doctor's office during the third day of the accident and got an apointment for my brother. I thought okay what ever I'll stay at home while he goes to the doctor but there was one person in the way of that and her is mom. She said that I had to go to the doctor with her and my brother even though I didn't want to. After that day I kept selling my mom excuses why I couldn't go but she wasn't buying them. So after a very short car ride that seemed to be a long car ride of torture, we were in the waiting room waiting. In that waiting room we were waiting, waiting, waiting and guess what else if you said waiting then you are right. In the waiting second got confused with minutes and minute got confused with hours. Those ''hours'' of torture made the car ride look like a kitty ride. There was no entertainment of anything that could distract those cruel minutes from going so slow. If have ever soon a snail go imagine that six times slower and you'll start to understand how slow the time went by. Finally after all of the time we've been waiting the doctor comes in the room and asks for my brother. The only problem with the doctor is that she is even more boring. The doctor sat and talked forever using word so long it make the look small. I was so tired that I stoped caring. Finally I was time to go hot no one was happy except for me.

Patient, a patient, or patience. Out there? Iâm going to talk about two kinds. Probably not the two you would think. I am going to discuss a patient and being patient. Although there is no pun intended, I feel that they both remind me of a story. One cold, dreary morning I had to take a trip. Not a field trip, nor a vacation. A trip to the doctorâs office.

266,267,7,Patience can mean a lot of things. It can mean to be understanding or it can mean to be tolerant. Being patient can also mean you donât complain. Like if you ask someone to get you something and they say that they will get it in a certain amount of days. If they donât get it the day they said they would and you were expecting it then you shouldânt get mad. You can also be paitient if you have to wait for something. If you are getting a new pair of shoes but the only way you can get them is they have to be ordered. You should not start to complain if it takes a long time. You should be able to wait without getting angry that you donât have them yet. Being patient can mean all of these things. If you do these things you can tell that you are patient. That is what being patient means.,4,Patience mean lot things  It mean understanding mean tolerant  Being patient also mean dont complain  Like ask someone get something say get certain amount days  If dont get day said would expecting shouldnt get mad  You also paitient wait something  If getting new pair shoes way get ordered  You start complain takes long time  You able wait without getting angry dont yet  Being patient mean things  If things tell patient  That patient means ,617,164,12,3.7621951219512195,2,19,45,14,5

Elderly often become confused, have a hard time hearing you, or just be a bit slower than you. You must practice patience and give them respect. Very young children are confused sometimes too because they are just learning. Toddlers will often become upset and refuse to do what you tell them to is you have no patience with them and start to yell, Patience is also important for mentally or physically challenged persons. If they are challenged, there is no way that they can help it. Mentally challenged people often don't understand or don't want to do things just like toddlers.

Patience is when you are willing to sit down and help someone with their own problems. I have a lot of patience cause I sit down all the time and help people with their problem.

304,305,7,"Finally, all those months of waiting are coming to an end! My mother is going to give me a cell phone! Although it was her old one, it will be new to me, Iâll be able to talk to my friends whenever I want. I not get the services I want, but at least Iâll have to stop worrying about being late for appointments. Like I said, the waiting is almost over. Okay, so Iâm not the most patient person in the world, but this is worth it! You see, Iâm going into track, cross-country, and choir. Since I ride the bus home and all of these activities end long after the buses leave, I need someone to pick me up. In order for that to happen, I need a cell phone. My mom said that first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. Last of all, I need to prove that I am deticated, I can keep my grades up, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen in sheâs transferred everything, Iâve proved Iâm deticated, Iâve kept my grades up, now I just have to prove that I am responsible. In order to do that, Iâve been watching the neighborâs pets while they are away, mowed their lawns, helped babysit their grandchildren, and Iâm working on cleaning the house and keeping it clean. So far, Iâve been able to persuade my dad and grandmother that I,m responsible. Even my brother and half-sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mum still isnât sure. I think that if I can clean half of the house and keep it clean until she will finally give me her old cell phone. Iâll probably have to clean up the mess after too though.

363,364,7,"During the my mom broke her wrist while we were riding our bikes down a trail. At the end of the trail mom turned a corner too fast and flipped over her handle bars. I didnât know her had broken her wrist until she stood up and told me. When she told me I froze, no one has ever had a broken bone in my family before so I didnât know what to do. Mom calmly told me we had to walk our bikes to the car, since we got to the trail by car. As we walked our bikes toward the car mom didnât say anything like how much pain she was in or anything. When we got to the car I had to put the bikes in the backseat. Now to those who donât know, bikes are a bit heavy and putting them in a backseat of a car is a bit hard. Also when your mom has a broken bone and is in alot of pain, and the bikes wonât go in the backseat the situation can get rather stressful. My mom saw that I was getting upset and told me to calm down and directed me on how to put the bikes in. After that mom told me to get her glasses that we accidentally left on the trail. I ran as fast as I could to get her glasses, but they were broken by the fall. So I ran all the way back to the car and since we had the same eyesight I gave her my glasses. My mom needed glasses because since Iâm not to yet she had to drive herself to the emergency room, and she did so without complaint. When we got to the emergency room we had to wait a while before anyone would see us. I was freaking out, but mom was actually telling jokes on how she got hurt doing something healthy like exercise.

She didnât once complain or whine about the pain she was in. she didnât yell at me when I was taking a while putting the bikes in the car.

It was as if I was the one who got hurt and she was being the mother as always and taking me to the emergency room.

412,413,7,"Patience is the key to tolerating trouble, problems, and helps you to not make tragic mistakes. You need to be patient when you even ??? a challenge in your life. Without patience, nothing would stop you from rushing into a situation with an unfocused mindset. If you try to deal with something without the necessary amount of patience, youâre quite likely to make a crucial mistake and/or degrade your chances of succeeding and reaching goal(s). In situations such as sports games arguments, disaster, and many other occurrances, patience will indeed come in handy. When playing sports, being patient will be helpful when youâre waiting to get playing time, when your team is behind, and when your teammates arenât doing their correct jobs and responsibilities on the team. Having patience, overall, will most likely help your team execute smooth, and by respecting sharing your opinion as well. Ultimately, this will help you sort out the situation a little more smoothly. During a disaster such as a house-fire or when dealing with tornado damage, being patient allows you to sort out all the things that youâve lost, and youâve enable to think clearly a bait what has just happened Iâve experienced a house fire so I know that being patient is a great way to handle and live through such a situation. Overall, I guess what Iâm trying to say is that when youâre patient you experience difficulties without complaining. Right now, you not think that this applies to you, but honestly, I can guarantee you that life isnât a âbundle of rosesâ all the time, so soon or later, youâre going to need to use patience. Waiting carefully for things to happen usually isnât human nature but its indeed a necessity in everyday life. So we all need to recognize the fast importance of patience, so we all can live better lives, Iâm certainly not implying that we need to hurry up and learn this trait, no, we simply need to learn it patiently.",5,Patience key tolerating trouble  problems  helps make tragic mistakes  You need patient even    challenge life  Without patience  nothing would stop rushing situation unfocused mindset  If try deal something without necessary amount patience  youre quite likely make crucial mistake andor degrade chances succeeding reaching goal    In situations sports games arguments  disaster  many occurrances  patience indeed come handy  When playing sports  patient helpful youre waiting get playing time  team behind  teammates arent correct jobs responsibilities team  Having patience  overall  likely help team execute smooth  respecting sharing opinion well  Ultimately  help sort situation little smoothly  During disaster housefire dealing tornado damage  patient allows sort things youve lost  youve enable think clearly bait happened Ive experienced house fire I know patient great way handle live situation  Overall  I guess Im trying say youre patient experience difficulties without complaining  Right  think applies  honestly  I guarantee life isnt bundle roses time  soon later  youre going need use patience  Waiting carefully things happen usually isnt human nature indeed necessity everyday life  So need recognize fast importance patience  live better lives  Im certainly implying need hurry learn trait   simply need learn patiently ,1541,347,14,4.4409221902017295,6,66,77,28,28

439,440,7,"Honestly, I really don't have a lot of patience. I get angry at the smallest things. I got it all from my dad. Usually. I will get impatient when I'm waiting for my mom to come out to her car. Sometimes we are leaving for dance, sometimes we go to the mall. Whatever it is, though, if we are late, I freak out. Even when I am going to something small like a birthday party, I hate being late for it because everyone is usually there by then and I will feel left out. Sometimes I get impatient because people are annoying me. For example, when someone is making random noises and I tell them to stop and they don't, it really wears out my patience. I also can't stand when someone starts poking me for no reason, that really irritates me. Another thing that makes me very impatient is when my parents are lecturing me about something I already know when I'm getting in trouble and I just want them to finish already. Sometimes, it will be for not cleaning my room and my mom will be lecturing me, saying things she has told me a million times and it bugs so much I just want to scream ""stop talking"". Other times, it will be for not taking my dishes from my room, bathroom, or hook down to the kitchen.

541,542,7,"Patience can come in different was in life. For one thing, it can reward you at the end. For example, it can come in a bigger way if you are patient because it would be a bigger reward to you. Another thing is that it lets you do other things in the process. For example you could wait for something, you could do something else when its time you deserve it. Another thing is that it might be difficult, but you can control it if your calm.

My mother had come in my room and told me I was allowed to open my presents, but before she did she said I need to have patience. Now as Iâm older, I know most right from attitudes, so when christmas comes I donât care about the gifts I remember when she had told me to be patient to receive because you might not be able to get everything you want and when your patient and listen to what your mother tells you to do so she can explain that I might not get alot or what I want. so now my patience is great for most things but since then I dont wanna rush and miss the details of what people have to say or I might get dissapointed. Patience is a thing where if you dont have it, then things wont be understood sometimes and things could not turn out the way you wanted them too. Enthusiasum is different from patience.

637,638,7,"Have you ever been patient? At some times, people lose their patients at many things. Examples of losing patients can be waiting in a line to go on a roller-coaster, because sometimes that can take forever. Having patients can be a good thing. Your calm and you donât have to be upset at somethings like waiting in a line somewhere for a long time. Being a patient person also means that you have the ability to wait for something, unlike people without patients, because those people will struggle while waiting for something. In conclusion, I think that having patients will sometimes help you to suceed in life. If your un-patient than you should try not to be because the thing you want or your waiting for will eventually happen someday.",4,Have ever patient  At times  people lose patients many things  Examples losing patients waiting line go rollercoaster  sometimes take forever  Having patients good thing  Your calm dont upset somethings like waiting line somewhere long time  Being patient person also means ability wait something  unlike people without patients  people struggle waiting something  In conclusion  I think patients sometimes help suceed life  If unpatient try thing want waiting eventually happen someday ,597,133,8,4.488721804511278,3,30,31,4,7

Well in my essay, Iâm going to discuss patience and how it affects our lives. In this day and age, itâs very hard to come across someone with a decent amount of patience. Due to all the ``@CAPS1â services and goods such as pizza delivery minute wash & dty acts people have begun to lose patience. What our generation has yet to realize is that we need that patience to get good jobs and get nice amounts of money. Another reason people need patience is their family. If you lack patience you wont be able to deal with your young and immature family members. For example I have no patience whatsoever so I canât deal with anyone younger than years old.

789,790,7,"Patience is a key role in life. If you are not paitent, you will live an unhappy life. Almost everything in life calls for patience. If you are not patient, you will most likely arrous something up like your job if you are not patient with your boss or co- workers. I often have a hard time being patient with my mom and dad. Sometimes I just canât stand my parents anymore and I lose my temper and become impatient with them and that usually makes things worse for me. I do love my brother but he can get really annoying, like most little brothers and sisters do. When my brother gets on my nerves, I become very impatient with him.

If your being impatient, you have to understand, that the people are most likely trying their hardest to finish what they are doing for your sake.

882,883,7,"What exactly is patience? Patience means to wait calmly for something. One of the times that I had to be patient was when I wanted my ears pierced. I tryed everything for four years, begging, pleading, even cleaning, but it still didnât work. My mom says I have to be before I can get my ears pierced. So instead of annoying her, I sat back and stayed patient. By doing that, I got my mom to change the age to twelve. So all I have to do is wait until soccer is finished and find a place and sheâll take me. Patience really helps in many different ways and I encourage you to try being patient when you want something, because it will all fall into place.",7,What exactly patience  Patience means wait calmly something  One times I patient I wanted ears pierced  I tryed everything four years  begging  pleading  even cleaning  still didnt work  My mom says I I get ears pierced  So instead annoying  I sat back stayed patient  By  I got mom change age twelve  So I wait soccer finished find place shell take  Patience really helps many different ways I encourage try patient want something  fall place ,511,129,9,3.9612403100775193,3,21,41,4,7

Whether youâre a kid or an adult, you must forgive yourself when you do wrong.

964,965,7,"Patience, essential part of our world. Patience deffeniatly some thing everybody needs. but not everybody has. I believe that everybody needs patience because everything takes time. And if you âdonât have the timeâ to do something then you donât have the time to live. And if nobody had the time to live then I wouldnât be here right now. I believe that patience more than just its deffinition. I believe that it means to be able to a low time to pass so you can do something. If all you did was work then good have a pretty boring life. For example if you had a teacher for elective class. She would have to be patient to be able to teach you the language of Otherwise she probably wouldnât be a teacher. Another example would be that lets say your on and your going to go to But traffic holding you down because of a car pile up. and you honk your horn. Thats not going to speed things up any more than they already are. Maybe your timing perfect when your honk but it doesnt make anything go any faster. When people hear someone honk their horn it most likely comes up as â@CAPS3 PERSON pretty much correct. When you honk your horn in traffic it doesnt make anything go faster, it makes things seem longer and people instantly label you as In conclusion I would like to state that patience important to mankind because if nobody had patience nobody would be on earth right now",5,Patience  essential part world  Patience deffeniatly thing everybody needs  everybody  I believe everybody needs patience everything takes time  And dont time something dont time live  And nobody time live I wouldnt right  I believe patience deffinition  I believe means able low time pass something  If work good pretty boring life  For example teacher elective class  She would patient able teach language Otherwise probably wouldnt teacher  Another example would lets say going go But traffic holding car pile  honk horn  Thats going speed things already  Maybe timing perfect honk doesnt make anything go faster  When people hear someone honk horn likely comes   CAPS PERSON pretty much correct  When honk horn traffic doesnt make anything go faster  makes things seem longer people instantly label In conclusion I would like state patience important mankind nobody patience nobody would earth right,1097,261,17,4.203065134099617,9,62,56,13,27

I was so happy when my parents made their final decision about buying them. We visited the puppies more time when they were still really young. After our last visit, we had to wait three whole weeks because they had to be old enough to go home with new families. These three weeks seemed to go by really slowly, but all of the waiting payed off. Being patient gave me a chance to get ready for the puppies. We bought them beds, toys, crates, and other dog essentials. We wanted to be prepared for our new family members. The day finally came to pick up the puppies. They were so adorable! We brought them home and we let them explore all around our house.They loved it! Our pigs turned out to be great dogs. I am so glad that I had to be patient when waiting for our pigs.

1033,1034,7,"I walked into the big open room. The smell of crayon, animal crackers and dirt overcome the air and hit my nose like a big wave rolling in from the sea. I take my first nervous steps into the room. The floor is covered with toys and a lot of crayons. The kindergartengs are running around screaming like little animals that hear d they were about to be eaten for dinner. The teacher is standing right in the middle of it all. She has a distant look in her eyes and she looks like sheâs about to cry. When she sees me and my name tag her face lights up a little bit. She practicly runs at me with arms open. The teacher introduces herself then says theyâre all mine. I never would have realized student teaching would have me doing so much teaching. I knew Iâd do a little but as the teacher introduced herself, then said she was leaving and I had to teach them the alphabet. So I was stuck with kids and a âwar.â I eventually, with some grabbing and pulling involved, get the kids to sit down criss-cross apple sauce on the floor. Itâs too bad I underestimated how wild they were. As I begin, one of kids starts throwing toys at me, so as calmly as possible I half growled,â thatâs not nice, please stop.â stops for about way too short seconds. So this repeats and I end up doing this with all the wild eyed, crazy haired dwarfs.Iit took a lot of stinking patience to get them to finally sit still. We got to about when the kinds got fussy again. At that point I was feeling more like a babysitter than a teacher. I was gradually understanding how that teacher was willing to leave. Finally I get that light bulb going off in my head feeling I run to my purse grab my bag of candy and say, âwhen we finish learning the alphabet A-@CAPS4, anyone who can say the whole thing will get a piece of candy!:â I realized tothem thatâs like gold to an adult. I was amazed and couldnât believe my ears. Every kid learned A-@CAPS4, I actually ran out of candy, although it took a lot of patience and pointless bicking.

1057,1058,7,"This year I tried out for the grade volleyball team for my school. There were so many girls trying out that I was nervous for what team I was going to get on or if I even would make a team. So I worked my hardest and figured, I had had experience from the other teams I was on before and I was now confident I would make the team. After of tryouts they had grouped us into either The A, or intermural team, according to your skill level. We got a letter that afternoon, and I made it into the A team! We then got right into practice and games. Winning most of the games, and improving on working as a team. Then a couple days ago, we played against middle school. As northern middle school, w obviously were rivals and were determined to beat them. For âbragging rigts,âwe joked, but most important because we really wanted to do our best. The first game was very close, but we won, and I played about half the time, surviving, hitting and moving all around the court. I felt very confident, in the second game also, even though I didnât play as much as I wished. I still had fun! In the game of volleyball, you play games in a match. The best two out of wins the match. At that time we had won both of the games, which ment we won, however we still had to play the third game. Even though we won the match our coach wanted us to win all Pretend like itâs the winning point, and play your hardest, she would say. So as the third game started, I was on the bench with some of the other players. I waited till about half of the game and wondered when I would be in. Time had gone by and I was getting discoureged because I hadnât played yet. I asked the coach a couple of times if I was going in or not, but she was too busy watching and coaching. So I sat, and about I point before the game ended, she looked at me and said, âcan you do it?âI shot right up and subbed in. I whent to the back of the line, tossed the ball in the air, and hit it! i had made the winning point! In the end I learned to trust my coach and to have patience, because it usually is for the best!

One reason is if someone or something getâs you mad, you need patience or you can get in trouble. For example if you get mad because of someone and you start a fight, youâll get in huge trouble. Or if you try doing something and you canât, you need patience or you can break something and get in trouble. Another reason for patience is if you are working with someone or teaching someone, you need patience so you donât hurt their feelings if they canât do something right. They might get mad and not want to be with you. A third reason for patience is if you know someone who keeps getting you mad or keeps humiliating you, you need to have patience with him/her. Just ignore the person so you both donât get in trouble. If you wouldnât have patience, things could end drastically.so that is why you should have patience.

All of us were getting sick of being quiet but we had to be in order for a buck could come. It was very cold and l was dressed warm but I was still could. There was a little heater in the shead thing we were in. we couldn't complain being cold or tired. Or just waiting, so we all sat there not complaining that was good.

The is not that hard but when you have to have paitence thats when it gets hard to you, and me. Pacents is key because you will have to use it for a long time! But lets get back on track shall we. On the when you are done you have to wait for your class mates to be done. So in that spare time you can read a book or check over your work. Pacents is also important because when you taking the you cant rush on it. You have to take your time and know that you are timed. Thats where pacents comes in!

One example of this might be if someone else is fixing something for you and you really waited them to be finished so you can move on with your life, but it is the type of thing that takes time, maybe a lot of time, but if you want it done right, you will have to wait. Sometimes it will not be a person you wait for, but an inamate object, like a television show, which can not be rushed, even though sometimes you want to ruch it. With a human however, if you rush them to do something, (which can happen it end up being not as good and even breaking in about ten seconds after them doing it, it end up happening faster though. You might also waight for nature too, such as a sunny day. When it have been raining for over a week. You also might be waiting for the power to come back on during storm.

1473,1474,7,"Patience is a quality that some people have and some people donât. it shows your character to people if your patient or not. It can be hard at times, but we all get through it. For example, when I was at a resturaunt that took forever to get our food to us, I had to be patient. I was sitting at the table after we ordered, and I got really bored so, I decide to color with crayons I got. After I was finished with that I decided that I needed to find something else to do while I was waiting. My mom was talking, so I chose to do that. I talked for a long time. Then our bread came. So, I ate that for a while and then got bored again. The waiter came and told us our food would be out soon. So, I continued to talk, went to the bathroom. When I came back our food was there! So I sat down and enjoyed the delicious meal. When I was patient I got a good reward out of it. Good things always come to people that are patient.

1483,1484,7,"There are two reasons why I think patience is important. The first is because if you are not patient, than you can end up distracting other people around you. For example, if you finished your test early and you kept telling everyone else to burry up itâs distracting. Now that youâve interrupted everyone, they have lost their train of thought and now they have to start over. A few weeks ago, my sister and I were out walking my dog and pulled so hard my little sister fell over and my dog ran away. We had to be patient and wait for him to return. My sister kept wanting to go call my mom to tell her the dog ran away again but I told her it would be rude to call because it would distract her from her work. Another reason why patience is important is because if you are not patient can get hurt. Letâs say you were going down the stairs and your sibling was in front of you and you needed to get downstairs quickly but they were walking down the stairs very slow, so you pushed them, they could get very hurt. In conclusion, patience is needed always and cannot be forgotten",5,There two reasons I think patience important  The first patient  end distracting people around  For example  finished test early kept telling everyone else burry its distracting  Now youve interrupted everyone  lost train thought start  A weeks ago  sister I walking dog pulled hard little sister fell dog ran away  We patient wait return  My sister kept wanting go call mom tell dog ran away I told would rude call would distract work  Another reason patience important patient get hurt  Lets say going stairs sibling front needed get downstairs quickly walking stairs slow  pushed  could get hurt  In conclusion  patience needed always forgotten,854,211,10,4.04739336492891,3,27,58,14,20

1512,1513,7,"Being patient is waiting quietly for something to happen. A lot of times, you have to patient for a lot of things, such as long lectures, birthdays, and orchestra concerts. Sometimes, no matter how patient you are, the thing you have been waiting for does not happen, and youâd have to leave without doing what you wanted to do for the whole time (and that has happened many times with me). For long lectures, sometimes you have the urge to leave. You have to be patient and wait for the lecture to end. For birthdays, you really want to eat the cake. But, yes, you do have to wait until your annoying sister finishes blowing out the candles and makes her wish. I am part of the orchestra, and we have a orchestra about every two months.

This is my story. A couple years ago, I was picked up from school. My mom was supposed to take me home, but she wanted to go grocery shopping first. When we were there, she asked if I wanted to come in. thinking about all of the reasons why I donât, of course I said no. I sat in the car when it was at least outside. I was sweating within ten minutes waiting in the vehicle. My mom still wasnât out of the store. There was so many times where I wanted to be angry, but I didnât let myself get this way. I even saw people come in and then come out before my mom got out of the store.

He didn't notice me when I crawled away from him, I was safe. The only problem now was that I needed a new place to I found one quick. Again I was waiting for over twenty minutes.
